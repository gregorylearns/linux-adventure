# Linux-adventure

After getting approved for my undergrad thesis, I went and used Xubuntu 18.04 full time. Making it my daily driver. Along the way I went and did customizations, fixes, and overall enhancement to the OS that probably no clean install could be like this.
Im making this retroactively seeing what improvements im making so that I can also replicate it if i ever decide to migrate to another distro or upgrade.

## Termdown

is a python library for a CLI countdown timer. Very useful for timers.
Install using

````
$ pip3 install termdown
````

## pyhostsman

Not actually installed yet but im trying to make it work to distance myself from distraction during work hours.

## WPS Office (Dec 2019)

Somehow after installing and testing out this software, I felt complete. This completed my longing for a fully-featured Office app for the distro. Somehow the thing that was missing from the installation is a reliable office app and photoshop (Sorry LibreOffice). Even with the notebookbar and office2013 icons added to the LibreOffice installation, it still didn't suffice for me. I felt like some Docx formatting is going to be destroyed. It felt a bit inadequate.
Also, the .deb file from their website is way better than the snap package.
The snap package won't open files from NTFS partitions. I followed the snap media tutorial for enabling this, it only works for the Spreadsheet app

## LibreOffice Addons

notebookbar and office 2013 icons.

## Fixing slow copying speeds

I read somewhere that PCManFM didn't have this problem vs. Thunar that XFCE is installed with. I found out that I liked PCManFM, but the problem still persisted. This fixed the problem.

## Photoshop CS6

Install the portable version through wine. Works surprisingly well.


## ANGRYSearch

A python based, Everything(Win only) alternative. It works okay, but not as great as Everything. Man I wish Everything had a port.
SublimeText


## XFCE Tiling

![From this reddit thread of tiling.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregorylearns/linux-adventure/master/images/xfce_tile.PNG)


## Linux MTP File Transfer
Not as seamless as it is in windows. I hate that it just doesnt work out of the box. I learned how to use ES File explorer FTP how to manage files. Now this (ES File Explorer) is nifty.


## Redshift GTK

I tried f.lux to work, but it doesn't. Redshift is very good and highly recommend.


## Wifi speed fix
Because im still dual booting my windows, I noticed that the wifi speed on my ubuntu was slower than the wifi speed on my windows. I found a fix online and applied it.
